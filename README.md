# Marvel Snap Card Checker
**Try it out at: **

Marvel Snap Card Checker is an application that takes a random card from the game and returns information about the character from the generated card, taken from the Marvel API.

Remade and improved, now built with Angular.

With this project I took my first steps with Angular, learned about:
- Components 
- HttpClient 
- Routing
- Observables 
- Services 
- Models
